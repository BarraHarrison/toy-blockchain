# ðŸ§± Week 1 â€“ Blockchain Fundamentals  
**Part of the Month 1: Blockchain & Ethereum Foundations Roadmap**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal  
Understand the fundamental building blocks of blockchain systems â€” how data is linked, validated, and secured â€” and implement a simplified blockchain prototype in TypeScript.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered  

### ðŸ”¹ Blockchain Architecture  
- Structure of a block (header, transactions, Merkle root, previous hash)  
- The concept of an immutable chain through cryptographic linkage  
- The role of the Merkle Tree for efficient transaction verification  

### ðŸ”¹ Consensus Mechanisms  
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: computational effort to secure consensus  
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: validation through economic stake  
- Comparison of energy efficiency, security, and decentralization tradeoffs  

### ðŸ”¹ Account Types  
- **Externally Owned Accounts (EOA):** controlled by private keys  
- **Contract Accounts:** controlled by deployed smart contract code

## ðŸ§  Algorithms & Data Structures Studied  

| Topic | Concept | Implementation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Hashing | SHA-256, Keccak-256 | Used to secure and link blocks |
| Merkle Trees | Binary hash tree | Provides integrity verification for transactions |
| Linked Lists | Sequential node linkage | Forms the basic blockchain structure |

## ðŸ§© Mini Project â€“ *Toy Blockchain in TypeScript*  

### Overview  
A simplified blockchain implementation demonstrating how transactions are grouped into blocks, validated through proof-of-work, and chained using cryptographic hashes.

### ðŸ”§ Features  
- Blocks linked via SHA-256 hashes  
- Simple transaction objects (`from`, `to`, `amount`)  
- Proof-of-Work mining (adjustable difficulty)  
- Merkle Tree integration for transaction verification  
- Chain validation function to ensure immutability
